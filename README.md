NSArray-OMRuntime
======================

Additional methods for NSArray/NSMutableArray to support array subscripting syntax for SDK's before iOS 6.
Xcode 4.4 does support the new modern Objective-C runtime features for NSNumber, NSArray and NSDictionary. All but subscripting (like myArray[42], or myArray[42]=@42).
